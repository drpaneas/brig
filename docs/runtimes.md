# The runtimes Brig drives

Brig delegates booting to a runtime, `hull` on macOS or `nerdctl` on
Linux, instead of booting a sandbox itself. See
[non-goals.md](non-goals.md#a-container-runtime-or-a-vmm) for why.

This page calls `hull` and `nerdctl` runtimes. Under hull, `vz`, `hvi`
and `qemu` are hypervisor backends, shortened to backend after this first
use.

If you adopt this stack, on macOS you take on Brig and hull. On Linux
you take on Brig, plus three projects it does not own: nerdctl,
containerd and urunc. `install.sh` installs those three for you on Linux,
from the bundle described in [install.md](install.md#linux). nerdctl and
containerd in that bundle are upstream releases. Its urunc is built from a
branch, because no urunc release reads the boot annotations Brig passes
([What Brig requires of each](#what-brig-requires-of-each)).

hull is published by the same organisation as Brig and exists because
Brig needed it. It is a usable runtime on its own, and its command
surface is not `brig`-shaped. nerdctl, containerd and urunc predate Brig
and are used far outside it. Brig is an ordinary caller of all three: it
passes flags any other caller can pass.

## The three macOS backends

hull accepts three values for its `--hypervisor` flag: `vz`, `hvi` and
`qemu`. Brig passes through whichever one the profile names, or
`BRIG_HYPERVISOR` when that is set.

`vz` talks to Virtualization.framework through the `vz-runner` helper. It
is what Brig falls back to when neither the profile nor
`BRIG_HYPERVISOR` names a backend. Brig always passes `--hypervisor`
explicitly, so hull's own default never decides it. It is also the only
backend that can show a graphical console, so a `kind: gui` profile is
refused on `hvi` and `qemu`.

`hvi` talks to Hypervisor.framework directly, through the `hvi` microVM
monitor. It is the only backend that runs a network gateway of its own.
An attached egress policy and `--network isolated` both refuse to run on
anything else.
Six of the eight shipped profiles set `hypervisor: hvi`, so most runs use
`hvi` rather than the `vz` fallback.

`qemu` is a third value hull accepts. Which framework it uses, if any, and
what it needs on the host are questions for hull's own documentation.
Nothing in Brig's source answers them.

`brig doctor`'s `Hypervisor.framework available` line is not a report on any
of these three backends. It is the pass string of one `kern.hv_support`
sysctl read, which asks only whether this Mac can back a microVM at all. It
never gates the exit status.

## Where the boundary sits

Brig decides, and the runtime never sees the reasoning:

- which image, and whether its signature verified (`internal/verify`)
- which host directory is the guest home
- which credentials are resolved, which are denied for billing safety, and
  which are handed in by name rather than by value
- the sandbox name, memory, CPU count, network mode, pull policy, root
  filesystem type, hypervisor backend and shared directories
- on macOS, the kernel and initrd paths for an image that carries no kernel,
  and the gateway address each sandbox takes

The runtime decides everything mechanical: how the image is pulled and
stored, and how the sandbox is configured and booted. It also decides
how a command gets into the guest, and what a stopped instance means.

Nothing is linked in. Brig has three direct Go dependencies:
`sigs.k8s.io/yaml` for the profiles, `golang.org/x/sys` for the terminal
and process calls, and `github.com/godbus/dbus/v5` for the Linux secret
store. Every interaction below is a subprocess, the same rule that
applies to `cosign` and `oras`.

## Every command Brig runs

Taken from the source. On macOS, from `internal/runtime/hull.go` unless another
file is named:

```
hull --version                          # does this hull boot a digest? (0.1.0-rc23 and later)
hull assets pull                        # HULL_BOOT_ASSETS=<dir> in the environment
hull assets dir
hull ps
hull ps -a                              # falls back to `hull ps` if -a is refused
hull run --detach --name <name>
     --hypervisor <vz|hvi|qemu> --net <shared|none>   # none is --network offline
     --pull <missing|always|never> --mem <MB> --cpus <n>
     [--rootfs-type <block|virtiofs|9pfs>]
     [--annotation com.urunc.unikernel.bootKernel=<path>]
     [--annotation com.urunc.unikernel.bootInitrd=<path>]
     [--gateway-sock <path> --gateway-cidr <cidr>]
     [--shared-dir <host>:<guest>[:ro]]...
     [--gui [--gui-title <title>]]
     [--env <NAME>|<NAME>=<value>]... <image>
hull exec [-t] [--cwd <dir>] [-u <user>] [--env <NAME>|<NAME>=<value>]... <name> -- <cmd>...
hull logs [--follow] [--tail <n>] <name>
hull stop <name>
hull rm <name>
hull network-gateway --help             # does this hull enforce a policy? (--egress-default)
hull network-gateway --socket <path> --qemu-socket <path>.qemu
     --subnet 198.18.0.0/24 --gateway-ip 198.18.0.1   # internal/runtime/gateway.go
hull network-gateway --socket <path> --qemu-socket <path>.qemu
     --subnet <a /30 of its own> --gateway-ip <first address on it>
     [--egress-default <allow|deny>]                  # an isolated sandbox, or one
     [--egress-allow <rule>]... [--egress-deny <rule>]...   # carrying a policy
```

`hull --version` is the one version Brig reads, and it reads it for one
decision. A hull from 0.1.0-rc23 boots a digest reference from its own
store, so Brig pins the image it verified. An older one boots the tag,
and Brig says so. An unreadable answer counts as pinning.
`network-gateway --help` is read for one word, `--egress-default`,
before a sandbox carrying a policy is booted. A gateway that does not
take the flag drops the rules on the floor, so the answer is `cannot
enforce` and Brig refuses the run. A probe that fails confirms nothing, so
the answer is `unknown` and Brig refuses the run then too: the binary does
not run, it exits non-zero, or it gives no answer within 30 seconds. A
sandbox with no policy runs no probe.

Brig picks that subnet from 198.18.0.0/15, the range RFC 2544 reserves
for network benchmarking. It is never routed on the public internet and
almost nothing claims it. A sandbox network is unlikely to collide
with something you need to reach. The alternatives are all
crowded: 10.0.0.0/8 by corporate VPNs and cloud VPCs, and 172.16.0.0/12
by Docker. Home routers and vmnet on macOS use 192.168.0.0/16, and
Tailscale uses 100.64.0.0/10. The sibling 198.19.0.0/16 is left alone
because OrbStack uses it.

`hull exec` is the whole exec path. The reachability probe, the captured
read, the credential written over stdin, and the terminal handover all
build the same argv (`execArgs`). The handover replaces the Brig process
with hull, so the guest gets a real terminal. `hull logs <name>` is what
`brig logs <ref>` runs, and it is also named in Brig's error output when
a sandbox will not come up.

On Linux, from `internal/runtime/nerdctl.go`:

```
nerdctl image inspect --format {{index .RepoDigests 0}} <ref>   # the digest to pin
nerdctl ps --filter name=^<name>$ --format {{.Names}}
nerdctl ps -a --format {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}
nerdctl network ls --format {{.Name}}
nerdctl network create <name>            # --network isolated: a network per sandbox
nerdctl network rm <name>                # with the sandbox, and by rm --all
nerdctl run --detach --name <name>
     --runtime io.containerd.urunc.v2         # BRIG_CONTAINERD_RUNTIME overrides
     --memory <MB>m --cpus <n>
     [--pull <missing|always|never>]
     [--network none | --network <name>]      # offline, or isolated
     [--annotation com.urunc.unikernel.bootKernel=<path>]
     [--annotation com.urunc.unikernel.bootInitrd=<path>]
     [--annotation com.urunc.unikernel.hypervisor=cloud-hypervisor]
     [-v <host>:<guest>[:ro]]... [--tmpfs <path>:<options>]...
     [-e <NAME>|<NAME>=<value>]... <image> sleep infinity
nerdctl exec -i [-t] [-w <dir>] [-u <user>] [-e <NAME>|<NAME>=<value>]... <name> <cmd>...
nerdctl logs [--follow] [--tail <n>] <name>
nerdctl stop <name>
nerdctl rm <name>
```

The container is parked on `sleep infinity` because a container exits when its
command does, and the sandbox has to outlive the exec that used it. As on
macOS, `nerdctl logs <name>` is what `brig logs <ref>` runs.

Two commands are not aimed at a runtime but run on the same paths:

```
oras pull ghcr.io/nofireai/hull-assets:<os>-<arch> --output <dir>
                                                # internal/runtime/bootfetch.go
cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp <identity>
     --certificate-oidc-issuer <issuer> <image> # internal/verify/verify.go
```

Every runtime command carries `HULL_TELEMETRY_PRODUCT=brig` and
`HULL_TELEMETRY_SUPPRESS=1` in its environment. Brig lifts the suppression
only for the operations a user asked for, so one Brig command counts once.
`DO_NOT_TRACK` and `HULL_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` pass through untouched and win.

Forwarded values travel in that same environment and only the bare variable
name goes in argv, so nothing readable in `ps` carries a secret. `BRIG_ENV_ARGV=1`
puts ordinary values back on the command line for a runtime build that cannot
take a bare `--env NAME`. A value Brig resolved on your behalf stays off
the command line even then.

The guest's `HOME`, `PATH`, `TMPDIR` and `XDG_*` go on the command line as
`--env NAME=value` (`-e NAME=value` for nerdctl), because the runtime reads
those names for itself. See [security.md](security.md#not-in-argv).

## How Brig finds the runtime

`internal/runtime/runtime.go`, in order:

1. `BRIG_RUNTIME` names the runtime, `hull` or `nerdctl`. Anything else is
   refused by name. Unset, it is `hull` on macOS and `nerdctl` everywhere else.
2. `BRIG_RUNTIME_BIN` is the executable to run. A path is taken as it stands,
   and a bare name is looked up on PATH. Either way, one that is missing or
   not executable is reported against the variable before anything runs.
3. A profile's `runtimeBin` does the same thing without a variable per shell,
   and loses to `BRIG_RUNTIME_BIN`. A leading `~` is expanded, and a path that
   is missing or not executable is reported against the profile that named it.
4. Otherwise PATH: `hull` for the hull runtime, and `nerdctl` then `docker`
   for the other one. When PATH has no `nerdctl` and Brig takes `docker`, it
   says so in one line: `brig` on stderr, `brigd` in the response's warnings.
   Name `docker` in `BRIG_RUNTIME_BIN`, or its full path in `runtimeBin`, to
   make it a choice, and the line goes away. `runtimeBin` does no PATH lookup,
   so a bare `docker` there is refused as missing.

What Brig asks the runtime about itself is short. It asks hull where its
boot assets live (`hull assets dir`). They sit under hull's own
store, and a path compiled into Brig can drift out of date silently. It asks either
runtime which sandboxes exist and what state they are in (`ps`). And it
asks hull two capability questions, `hull --version` for digest pinning
and `network-gateway --help` for policy enforcement, both described
above. `brig info <ref>` prints what it settled on, as
`runtime hull (/opt/homebrew/bin/hull)`, and `brig doctor` reports the
runtime's version beside the rest of the host.

Neither answer gates the run outright, and that is deliberate: Brig degrades
one feature at a time rather than refusing an old build. A hull without
`assets dir` falls back to `~/.hull/assets`. A runtime without `ps -a` falls
back to the plain listing, and a hull that cannot pin a digest boots the tag
and says so. The one refusal is a policy on a gateway that cannot enforce it.
A hull too old for a flag Brig passes fails at that flag, with hull's own
message.

## What Brig requires of each

**hull** has to accept the verbs and flags listed above, and three things
beyond them:

- a bare `--env NAME`, taking the value from its own environment. Without it
  the only way to forward a credential is `BRIG_ENV_ARGV=1`, which puts values
  where `ps` can read them. It also takes `--env NAME=value`, which is how
  the guest's `HOME`, `PATH`, `TMPDIR` and `XDG_*` arrive.
- `exec -u root`, which is how Brig mounts a tmpfs inside a running sandbox.
  Container runtimes get their tmpfs at create time instead
  (`internal/wrap/secretfiles.go`).
- `network-gateway`, for the `hvi` backend. That backend has no egress of its
  own, so Brig starts one shared gateway and joins every sandbox to it. Brig
  also hands out the addresses on that network itself. Guests on one gateway
  reach each other, measured on hull 0.1.0-rc29. See
  [security.md](security.md#things-brig-does-not-claim) for the answer per
  backend. A gateway started by an older Brig has no API socket, so it cannot
  publish a port. The next boot replaces it when no sandbox is on it and no
  other boot is starting on it.

Six of the eight shipped profiles ask for `hvi` and set `genericBoot: true`
(`internal/profile/specs`). The default macOS path needs the `hvi` binary
beside hull, a working gateway, and the boot bundle. `BRIG_HYPERVISOR=vz` moves
to the other backend, and the graphical profile is refused anywhere but `vz`,
which is the backend with a console.

**nerdctl** has to carry `--annotation` through to the shim, take
`--runtime`, and honour `-v`, `--tmpfs` and a bare `-e NAME`. `docker` is
accepted in its place and works for an image that carries its own
kernel. docker does not pass annotations to the runtime, so a
`genericBoot` profile is refused on it rather than attempted. Without
the annotations, the sandbox boots with no kernel and fails somewhere
far from the cause.

**urunc** has to read `com.urunc.unikernel.bootKernel` and
`com.urunc.unikernel.bootInitrd` from the container's OCI spec and boot the
image with them. It is the same pair hull takes on its command line. Brig
also passes `com.urunc.unikernel.hypervisor=cloud-hypervisor` on every
`genericBoot` run, so urunc has to find a `cloud-hypervisor` binary.

No urunc release reads the pair, v0.8.0 included. A release ignores both
annotations and looks for a `urunc.json` in the image instead. A stock image
has none, so the sandbox never becomes ready, while `brig doctor` reports the
runtime and the boot assets as `ok`. The pair is implemented on the
`feat/unchanged_containers-exec-fixes` branch of
[urunc-dev/urunc](https://github.com/urunc-dev/urunc). The runtime bundle
builds its urunc from that branch, and its `container-initrd` from the same
commit. A host that brings its own urunc (`BRIG_INSTALL_RUNTIME=0`) needs a
build from that branch too.

**containerd** has to be running with the urunc shim installed.
`BRIG_CONTAINERD_RUNTIME` can point at another microVM shim, but a shim Brig
knows shares the host kernel, `runc` or `crun`, is refused; `docs/security.md`
says why a kernel of the guest's own is the boundary Brig provides.

**Each run path**, a runtime with one backend, answers one capability
question before a run that carries an egress policy: does it enforce the
policy. The answer is `enforced`, `cannot enforce` or `unknown`, and it
comes from one table, shown in
[docs/policies.md](policies.md#where-a-policy-is-enforced-and-where-it-is-not).
hull on `hvi` answers `enforced` as long as its `network-gateway --help`
exits zero within 30 seconds and lists `--egress-default`. hull on `vz`
and `qemu`, and nerdctl or docker on any shim, answer `cannot enforce` and
run no probe. hull on a backend the table does not name answers `unknown`.
Brig boots a policy-bound run only on `enforced`, and the refusal names
the property, the runtime and the backend.

### Versions and pins

Brig's source pins no version of hull, nerdctl, containerd or urunc, and
verifies no digest of any of them. The pin lives on the install path: the
hull cask in `brig-sh/homebrew-brig` names one release tarball and its
sha256. Brig's cask depends on that cask, so `brew install --cask
brig` gets the exact build the tap names. Both casks are hand-written
for the prerelease series, so read `Casks/hull.rb` for what an install
will actually give you.

On Linux the pin is `RUNTIME_VERSION` in `install.sh`, which names one
release of the runtime bundle. With cosign available, `install.sh` checks the
signature on that release's `checksums.txt` before it runs the bundle's
installer. The bundle's `pins.env` records the urunc commit it was built
from, and `brig-ctl version` prints it.

The boot bundle is the other thing with a digest attached. hull verifies
its signature with cosign against the publishing workflow before writing
it, and records the digest it verified. Brig delegates the whole fetch
to hull on macOS for exactly that reason. The Linux runtime bundle does not
use it: its launcher points `BRIG_BOOT_ASSETS` at the kernel and initrd the
bundle carries. On a Linux host without that bundle, the boot bundle arrives
through `oras` with no such verification, and `BRIG_BOOT_ASSETS_REF` is how
you pin a version or point at a mirror. On macOS Brig passes it to hull as
`HULL_BOOT_ASSETS_REF`, so hull fetches the reference Brig checked. There it
pins a version of `ghcr.io/nofireai/hull-assets`. hull refuses a reference in
any other repository unless `HULL_BOOT_ASSETS_ALLOW_FOREIGN` is set, and Brig
does not set it. With `BRIG_BOOT_ASSETS_REF` unset, Brig drops any
`HULL_BOOT_ASSETS_REF` from the environment it hands hull.

## Swapping one out

Cheap swaps, no code:

- a different build of the same runtime: `BRIG_RUNTIME_BIN`, or `runtimeBin` in
  a profile.
- docker instead of nerdctl: it is already in the PATH search, with the
  `genericBoot` limitation above.
- a different containerd shim: `BRIG_CONTAINERD_RUNTIME`. Anything that reads
  the two boot annotations replaces urunc without Brig noticing. The envelope's
  `ISOLATION` row names the shim you put there. It calls the boundary unknown
  rather than a microVM for any shim other than urunc's own that it cannot
  place. A shim Brig can place as sharing the host kernel, `runc` or `crun`,
  is refused.
- a different hypervisor backend under hull: `BRIG_HYPERVISOR`, or
  `hypervisor:` in a profile.

Replacing hull or nerdctl entirely is a code change, not a setting.
`BRIG_RUNTIME` accepts those two words and nothing else. A third
runtime means implementing the `Runtime` interface in
`internal/runtime/runtime.go`, and adding a case to `DetectFor`. That
interface lists kind, binary, running, list, run, probe, output, feed,
replace, stop, remove, and logs hint. It is the whole of what Brig needs
from a runtime, which is the useful part of the answer. If hull stopped
tomorrow, what needs rebuilding is a program that boots an OCI image as
a microVM and can exec into it. Nothing about guest homes, credentials
or profiles needs to change. Those live above the seam and are written
once for both operating systems.

### What is shared, and what is Brig's alone

Shared with other projects: containerd, nerdctl and urunc, none of which know
Brig exists. cosign and oras likewise.

Shared between Brig and hull: the boot bundle, the on-disk layout it lands in,
and the two annotation names. A machine that has run either runtime has already
seeded the other.

hull, `vz-runner` and `hvi` exist for this stack, though hull is a general
microVM runtime and does not depend on Brig.

Brig's alone: profiles, the secret store and its provenance records, the
credential forwarding rules, and the billing denylist. Also alone: the
guest home contract, image verification policy and `brigd`.

## Building hull from source on macOS

Skip this section unless you are working on hull itself.

A from-source hull cannot boot a microVM unless it is signed with an
Apple identity. This is the requirement that surprises people, so it is
worth being exact about it.

The backends do not talk to the hypervisor themselves. `vz-runner` does,
and it needs the `com.apple.security.virtualization` entitlement. `hvi`
talks to Hypervisor.framework instead and needs
`com.apple.security.hypervisor`. macOS honours an entitlement only on a
binary signed with a real Apple identity, an Apple Development or
Developer ID Application certificate. An ad-hoc signature
(`codesign --sign -`) gets the entitlement honoured only with AMFI
disabled, which means disabling SIP and setting a boot argument. Copying
an entitled binary strips its signature, so it has to be re-signed after
every build and every copy.

hull's `make macos` builds and signs all three binaries when given a
`CODESIGN_IDENTITY`, and its README documents the entitlement plists.
Since the shipped Brig profiles ask for the `hvi` backend, a from-source
build needs the `hvi` binary signed too, not only `vz-runner`.

The released hull is signed, notarized and stapled, so
`brew install --cask brig` gives you a runtime that boots without any of
this.

Building Brig from source needs none of it. Brig holds no entitlement and
drives whatever hull it finds.
