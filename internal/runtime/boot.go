//
// An ordinary OCI image carries no kernel, so something has to supply one. The
// runtime takes the kernel and initrd as OCI annotations and never from the
// image's own metadata, so that an image cannot nominate a file on the host --
// which is what makes finding them brig's job rather than the image's.
//
// Both backends read the same two annotations: hull on its command line, and
// urunc from the container's OCI spec on Linux, where nerdctl passes them
// through with --annotation. So the pair below is the whole contract, and it
// is spelled once. On Linux that takes the urunc the runtime bundle builds,
// since no urunc release reads the pair (docs/runtimes.md).

	// unsaid, a host without a system qemu gets "vmm not found" from the shim,
	// three layers from anything that mentions a monitor, while brig doctor
	// reports the runtime and the boot assets as fine. urunc validates the
	// pair, and cloud-hypervisor with a Linux guest is one it accepts.

	// hull does not read this: it takes its backend as --hypervisor, from a
	// different set of names entirely (vz, hvi), which is why this is appended
	// on the Linux path rather than added to the pair below.

// it downloads this same bundle for its own `hull run`, so it knows the
// reference and the credentials already. On Linux hull does not build -- most
// of its command surface is //go:build darwin -- so oras pulls the artifact
// directly.
//
// Deliberately two implementations rather than one shared package. What has to
// agree between them is a four-item contract -- this directory, the two file
// names, and the reference scheme -- not the mechanics of pulling an artifact
// and writing its layers. Sharing the mechanics would mean promoting hull's
// package to a public API and taking its registry client, credential helper and
// docker/containerd tree as brig dependencies, against the one dependency brig
