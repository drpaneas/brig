// the host kernel; brig will not boot one (see refuseSharedKernel), and this
// row still names it on `brig info`, which resolves the shim without booting.

// name -- may well be a VM, and brig has no way to establish that from a shim
// name, so it says so instead of picking the answer the reader would prefer.
