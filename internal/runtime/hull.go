// VMM is up -- seconds before the in-guest agent binds its listener. An exec
// aimed at that window sends its open request into nothing and then blocks in
// the frame loop with no deadline, forever.
//
// A caller that retries cannot see that: waitReady's own deadline is only
// consulted between probes, so the first probe never returning means the
// timeout never fires and `brig run` hangs with nothing printed. Bounding the
// call here is what makes the retry loop above a retry loop.
//
// Generous on purpose. This is not how long the guest may take to come up --
// that is ReadyTimeout, across many probes -- only how long one probe waits
// before deciding this attempt landed too early and another one is due.

// pipe ends, and the pipe stays open as long as anything holds its write end
// -- a grandchild the killed process left behind holds it just as well as the
