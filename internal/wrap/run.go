// boot rather than a fresh creation. A sandbox that was not running is not a
// failure worth reporting -- the end state is the one that was asked for.
//
// A sandbox that would not stop IS worth reporting, and used to be swallowed:
// `brig stop` discarded the runtime's error and exited 0, so a VM still
// running with a forwarded credential in it read as one that was gone. The end
// state is still what decides -- an instance that is no longer running when
// the runtime complains was already in the state that was asked for -- so the
// runtime is asked again before its error is believed, which is also what
// keeps "it was not running to begin with" from becoming a failure.
//
// Only an answer clears a failed stop. A runtime that could not say whether the
// sandbox is still up has not established the end state, and treating that as
// "gone anyway" puts the swallow back: the user is told a VM holding a
// forwarded credential is down when nothing checked.
