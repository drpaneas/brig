// Preview walks the same chains Bind walks and says what each delivers,
// without a secret value.
//
// stored answers for the store from a listing: whether a name is there, and
// whether the store answered at all. A listing reads no value. That lets a
// plan run on a host whose keychain prompts for a read, and keeps a plan from
// being one more place a value passes through.
//
// The price is that a listing cannot see an empty value: it reads names and
// attributes, and on macOS an empty secret still has a sealed ciphertext.
// A secret another tool emptied is resolved here, and Bind does not deliver
// it: as the last element of a chain the run drops it with the "empty, not
// absent" warning, and anywhere earlier Bind moves on to the next element
// while this row names the empty one. So resolved from the store means the
// listing has the name, not that the value is non-empty.
//
// lookup is the shell, as Bind reads it. A shell value is read only to apply
// the same guards Bind applies, and it goes nowhere.
//
// The rows come out sorted by delivery and name, because a digest is taken
// over them and the profile's order is not a permission.
