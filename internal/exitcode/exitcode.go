// Package exitcode maps a finished run's error to the stable exit status brig
// promises a script.
//
// The set is the exit-code table in docs/cli.md, "Exit codes": 1 a
// general failure, 2 a usage error, 3 no such profile or sandbox, 4 a runtime
// that is missing or broken, 5 a boot verification refused, 6 a credential that
// could not be resolved, 7 a run path that cannot enforce a property the run
// asks for. A caller that only checked "zero or not" keeps working;
// one that wants to branch on the reason now can.
//
// cmd/brig/exit.go is the other producer of these numbers -- it classifies the
// same internal error types for the CLI. It is package main and cannot be
// imported, and an open PR is editing it, so it is left where it is; once the
// branches touching it land it is to be moved onto this package so there is one
// classifier rather than two that can drift. Do not do that move here.
