// Exit codes brig promises to a script. They are documented in docs/cli.md,
// under "Exit codes".
//
// The mapping below is no longer the only thing that produces them:
// internal/exitcode classifies the same numbers for brigd, which cannot import
// this package. The two agree today -- same order, same classes, same
// numbers -- and they agree by construction rather than by sharing code, which
// is the drift this comment used to rule out. Collapsing them means lifting
// usageError and notFoundError somewhere both can see, since those are the
// types this file reads and that package has to approximate. Until then, a
// change here belongs in internal/exitcode too.
//
// 1 stays the general failure and 2 stays the usage error, so a caller written
// against either keeps working. The rest name the failure shapes brig's own
// paths already produce -- a profile that does not exist, a runtime that is
// missing or broken, a boot refused over verification, a credential that could
// not be resolved, a run path that cannot enforce a property the run asks for
// -- and nothing else, because a code no path returns is worse than no code at
// all.
